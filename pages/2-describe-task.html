  <p>Great job! Here is what will happen on each trial of this task:
    <p>You will first fixate on a cross, then be shown 3 images in quick succession.
    <p>You have to maintain your eyes' fixation on where the cross was throughout the presentation of these 3 images. That is, try not to move your eyes throughout the presentation of the images.</p>
  <p> Your task is to determine if the last (third) image is the same as the first or second image.
    <p>Please use the keys <strong>f</strong>, <strong>s</strong> for <strong>first</strong> and <strong>second</strong>, respectively.<br>
  Please answer quickly, and as accurately as you can.</p>
