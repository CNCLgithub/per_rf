  <p>Welcome to the <strong>Metamer experiment</strong>!</p>
  <p>In this experiment, you will be asked to <strong>determine if two images are the same</strong>.
    <br>You will first fixate on a cross, then be shown 3 images in quick succession.
    <br>You have to maintain your eyes' fixation on where the cross was throughout the presentation of these 3 images. That is, try not to move your eyes throughout the presentation of the images.</p>
      <p> The goal is to determine if the last (third) image is the same as the first or second image. Please use the keys <strong>f</strong>, <strong>s</strong> for <strong>first</strong> and <strong>second</strong>, respectively.<br>
  Please answer quickly, and as accurately as you can.</p>
