  <p>Here is what will happen on each trial of this task:
    <p>You will first focus on the crosshairs in the center of the screen. Then
      3 images will flash quickly.
   
    <p>Keep your eyes on the crosshairs and the location of the crosshairs as
      the 3 images flash across the screen.
    <p>Try not to move your eyes from the position of the crosshairs.
    <p>Your job is to decide if the third image is the same as the first image that flashed or if it is the same as the
      second image that flashed.

    <p>You will use the ‘f’ key on your keyboard if it is the first image and you will
      use the ‘j’ key on your keyboard if it is the second image.
    <p>It will be helpful for you to keep your fingers comfortably and constantly
      placed on the ‘f’ and ‘j’ keys.
    <p>Please answer as quickly and as accurately
      as you can.
